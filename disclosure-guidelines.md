# Disclosure Guidelines

All technology contains bugs. If you've found a security vulnerability, we'd like to help out. By submitting a vulnerability to our program, you acknowledge that you have read and agreed to these guidelines.

## Philosophy

Finders should...

* **Respect the rules.** Operate within the rules set forth by TextMaster, or speak up if in strong disagreement with the rules
* **Respect privacy.** Make a good faith effort not to access or destroy another user's data
* **Be patient.** Make a good faith effort to clarify and support their reports upon requests
* **Do no harm.** Act for the common good through the prompt reporting of all found vulnerabilities. Never willfully exploit others without their permission
