# Introduction

TextMaster's bug bounty program is our way to reward security researchers for finding serious security vulnerabilities.

We look forward to working with all security researchers and strive to be respectful, always assume the best and treat others as peers. We expect the same in return from all participants. To achieve this, our team strives to:

* Reply to all reports
* Be as transparent as possible, answering all inquiries about our report decisions
* Award fair value bounties based on CVSS scores
* Only close reports as `Non Applicable` when the issue reported is listed in the [Known Issues](./#known-issues), [Ineligible Issues](./#ineligible-issues) sections or lacks evidence of a vulnerability
* Reward any report mistakenly closed as invalid if we later receive and reward the same bug reported by someone else. In these situations, we will reward both security researchers
* Pay the bounty difference to the duplicate reporter in case the new report demonstrates a higher CVSS score
