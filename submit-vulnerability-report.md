# Submit Vulnerability Report

We've set up a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/textmaster/bugbounty/security/advisories) to submit vulnerability reports.

Open a new draft security advisory and follow the templates, providing as much information as possible about the potential issue you have discovered. The more information you provide, the quicker TextMaster will be able to validate the issue.

**Tips:** If you haven't yet, please remember to review our [Policy](broken-reference) and [Disclosure Guidelines](disclosure-guidelines.md).
{% endhint %}

Use the built-in severity calculator to get your severity vector string. Note that currently, GitHub does not support Temporal and Environmental scores. Therefor, your severity score might be lowered down after submitting your draft according to our policy.

Follow these steps to submit a new report:

1. Go to our bug bounty public repository [https://github.com/textmaster/bugbounty](https://github.com/textmaster/bugbounty)
2. Click on the Security tab
3. Click on the Advisories sub-menu
4. Click on the New draft security advisory button
5. Fill in your report following the guidelines
6. Once you're satisfied with your report, click the Create draft security advisory button
